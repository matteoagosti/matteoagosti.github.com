    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have recently installed MySQL 5.5 on Mac OS X you have probably faced some issues with anything that relies on libmysqlclient as, for example, the handy <code>node.js db-mysql</code> or <code>gem mysql2</code> modules.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The problem lies into the fact that the system doesn't know the full path to the library. To solve the issue, you simply have to setup the full path in your enviroment variables. Assuming you have a UNIX system with a Bash shell you could simply run the following command:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to try out <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Visit Octopress website if you are looking for a blogging framework for hackers">Octopress</a> for handling my personal website. As always, things never go as smooth as it should be, otherwise where is the fun?</p>

<p>The major flaw I had to face was the failure in compiling some Ruby extensions, apparently due to missing header files and binaries.</p>

<p>My system currently runs OS X 10.7.4 with Xcode 4.3 and the <a href="http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/command_line_tools_for_xcode__february_2012/command_line_tools_for_xcode_.dmg" title="Download the standard command line tools for Xcode. Warning, requires an Apple Developer account">standalone command line tools</a> installed (the latter is not any longer packaged into Xcode and has to be installed manually).</p>

<p>After having checked that all required libs and tools were installed on my system I started to think on a path-related issue. Before Xcode 4.3, in fact, all dev related stuff was stored in <code>/Developer</code>, whereas since Xcode 4.3 everything is packed inside the application folder itself.</p>

<p>I found out the handy command line tool <code>xcode-select</code> whose responsability is to manage the path for Xcode and UNIX tools and decided to force the new path:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>That did the trick and the fact that you are reading this on Octopress proves its success :P</p>
